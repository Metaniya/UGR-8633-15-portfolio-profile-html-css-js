            I earned my Bachelor's degree in Software Engineering from Addis
            Ababa University. My academic journey was enriched by interesting
            courses such as Java, Python, and Web Development. Beyond academics,
            I actively participated in the

            To enhance my skills further, I completed two certifications from
            SheCodes in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. For my final project, I
            developed a user-friendly and interactive webpage, which is
            showcased on my
