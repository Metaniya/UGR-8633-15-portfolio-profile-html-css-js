              <span>Addis Ababa, Ethiopia (2020 - 2022)</span> As a Software
              Developer at EthioTech Solutions, I had the opportunity to work in
              a fast-paced and collaborative environment. I was part of a team
              responsible for designing and implementing scalable backend
              systems that powered several high-traffic applications. My primary
              focus was on utilizing Python to develop efficient, maintainable
              code while integrating PostgreSQL for data management.

          <h2>E-Learning Platform for Ethiopian Students</h2>
          <p>
            As part of my passion for education and social impact, I developed
            an e-learning platform tailored specifically for Ethiopian high
            school students. The platform offers interactive courses in key
            subjects, such as mathematics and science, along with practice
            quizzes that help students prepare for their national exams. One of
            the major challenges I faced was ensuring the platform could be used
            in rural areas with limited internet access. To overcome this, I
            implemented an offline-accessible mode that allowed students to
            download lessons and quizzes to study without needing a constant
            internet connection. This project not only improved my technical
            skills in building web applications but also gave me the opportunity
            to contribute to the educational sector in Ethiopia.

          <h2>Global Freelance Marketplace</h2>
          <p>
            Another project I worked on was creating a global freelance
            marketplace designed to connect talented freelancers from developing
            countries with international clients looking for affordable and
            high-quality services. The platform allows freelancers to set up
            profiles, list their services, and bid on projects. I implemented
            secure payment gateways that support multiple currencies, including
            the Ethiopian Birr, allowing local freelancers to receive payment
            easily and securely.

          <h2>Volunteer Web Developer</h2>
          <p>
            n addition to my professional experience, I have also volunteered as
            a web developer for several organizations focused on improving
            digital literacy in underserved communities across Africa. One
            notable project was building a resource hub for aspiring African
            developers, offering free access to tutorials, tools, and
            mentorship. I contributed to an open-source initiative aimed at
            providing digital education to individuals in areas with limited
            access to formal education resources. Working with other passionate
            volunteers, I helped develop and maintain the website while also
            offering guidance to new learners on the platform. This experience
            further fueled my dedication to using technology to empower
            communities and provided me with an opportunity to collaborate on
            global projects. Remember:
