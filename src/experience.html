            <h2>EthioTech Solutions</h2>
            <p>
              <span>Addis Ababa, Ethiopia (2020 - 2022)</span> As a Software
              Developer at EthioTech Solutions, I had the opportunity to work in
              a fast-paced and collaborative environment. I was part of a team
              responsible for designing and implementing scalable backend
              systems that powered several high-traffic applications. My primary
              focus was on utilizing Python to develop efficient, maintainable
              code while integrating PostgreSQL for data management. I actively
              participated in code reviews, sprint planning, and testing
              processes to ensure the quality and performance of the
              applications. This experience helped me hone my problem-solving
              skills and deepen my understanding of software architecture and
              development practices.

            <p>
              <span>Remote (2022 - Present)</span>Currently, I am working as a
              remote Software Developer for TechGlobe Solutions. My role
              involves designing and developing a scalable task management
              application that has been adopted by over 5,000 users globally.
              The app allows teams to effectively manage projects and track
              progress with real-time collaboration features. I am responsible
              for both front-end and back-end development, utilizing
              technologies such as React for building interactive user
              interfaces and Node.js for building fast and scalable back-end
              services.

        <h1>Additional Experience</h1>
        <p>
          Beyond my formal roles, I have gained valuable experience through
          personal projects and volunteering.
        </p>

        <h2>E-Learning Platform for Ethiopian Students</h2>
        <p>
          As part of my passion for education and social impact, I developed an
          e-learning platform tailored specifically for Ethiopian high school
          students. The platform offers interactive courses in key subjects,
          such as mathematics and science, along with practice quizzes that help
          students prepare for their national exams. One of the major challenges
          I faced was ensuring the platform could be used in rural areas with
          limited internet access. To overcome this, I implemented an
          offline-accessible mode that allowed students to download lessons and
          quizzes to study without needing a constant internet connection. This
          project not only improved my technical skills in building web
          applications but also gave me the opportunity to contribute to the
          educational sector in Ethiopia.
        </p>

        <h2>Global Freelance Marketplace</h2>
        <p>
          Another project I worked on was creating a global freelance
          marketplace designed to connect talented freelancers from developing
          countries with international clients looking for affordable and
          high-quality services. The platform allows freelancers to set up
          profiles, list their services, and bid on projects. I implemented
          secure payment gateways that support multiple currencies, including
          the Ethiopian Birr, allowing local freelancers to receive payment
          easily and securely.
        </p>

        <h2>Volunteer Web Developer</h2>
        <p>
          n addition to my professional experience, I have also volunteered as a
          web developer for several organizations focused on improving digital
          literacy in underserved communities across Africa. One notable project
          was building a resource hub for aspiring African developers, offering
          free access to tutorials, tools, and mentorship. I contributed to an
          open-source initiative aimed at providing digital education to
          individuals in areas with limited access to formal education
          resources. Working with other passionate volunteers, I helped develop
          and maintain the website while also offering guidance to new learners
          on the platform. This experience further fueled my dedication to using
          technology to empower communities and provided me with an opportunity
          to collaborate on global projects.
